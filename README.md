# KLists

NAME: Michelle Quach

DATE OF COMPLETION: September 18, 2020 

PURPOSE OF LAB: Understanding mergesort and the process of merging arrays.  

METHOD USED: We used the merge method given during lecture to merge the subarrays with one another. More specifically, we would merge the outer array with each subarray since the subarrays were in sorted order already. This means that we would compare the values in the subarray with the values in the the outer array.  

RUNTIME / SPACE COMPLEXITY:
Runtime: O(n^2) because the merge method is done n times and when it is called in mergeKLists, it is being called n amount of times. 

Space Complexity: O(1) because we are only creating temporary variables and arrays.
